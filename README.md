**GODMODE + SPAWN TIMERS + MORE ABILITIES SPAMMABLE**

INFO/UPDATES:

-Godmode has been added.
-Unpatched hide name.
-Sleep, Moku, and Pika are now spammable.
-Merged Abilities together so you don't have to pick buttons when you start up script.
-Brand new Spawn Timers labels which also glows yellow if the certain item is spawned in. (Press L to hide them)
-Hide name notifier and Other keys label.

NOTES:

You must have either Sleep/Kage/Mera/Moku/Pika equipped in order for SpamAbility to work.
Animations will freeze when using Godmode.
Bringing items can also re-equip the current tool you have by its name. (So if you have a uneaten fruit with the same name its gonna be weird might fix later)
Bringing items won't let you accidently eat or use any item.
You don't need full quest name for AutoGetQuest to work.
BringItems/SpamAbility/AutoGetQuest are all toggleable.
MouseTP may or may not work depending on if the game will let you do it idk.

Other Keys:

N to Destroy Trash DFs in inventory. (Sleep/Blaze/FireBreath/Voice)
M to equip all urns.
L to Hide Spawn Timers.
